defmodule PhoenixKitCatalogue.Web.LegacyPathController do
  @moduledoc """
  Sends the module's old admin addresses on to the current ones.

  The pages lived under `/admin/catalogue` — singular, while the module is
  "Catalogues" everywhere a person reads it. They are under
  `/admin/catalogues` now, and this keeps what still points at the old
  address working: bookmarks, links in sent mail and in the activity log,
  and sibling modules released before the change. The settings page moved
  the same way, from `/admin/settings/catalogue` to
  `/admin/settings/catalogues`.

  The rest of the path, the locale and URL prefix in front of it, and the
  query string all carry over unchanged.

  Admin-only, like the module's other HTTP route: a signed-out visitor is
  sent to log in, not told where the admin pages live.

  ## A renamed admin area

  A host may rename `/admin` (`config :phoenix_kit, admin_path:`), and core
  rewrites every route to the configured segment — these included, so on a
  host that calls it `/backoffice` the old address arrives as
  `/backoffice/catalogue`. The moves are therefore written canonically and
  put through `Routes.apply_admin_segment/1` before they are looked for;
  matching the literal `/admin/…` would find nothing there and redirect the
  request to itself, permanently.
