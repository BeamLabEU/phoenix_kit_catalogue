defmodule PhoenixKitCatalogue.Workers.PdfExtractor do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker that extracts text page-by-page from a PDF through the
  `PdfEngines` chain: pdfium (in-app precompiled NIF — no system
  packages needed) first, poppler (`pdfinfo`/`pdftotext`) as the
  fallback when installed.

  Keyed by `file_uuid` (core's `phoenix_kit_files.uuid`), not the
  per-upload `phoenix_kit_cat_pdfs.uuid` — so two uploads of identical
  content share one extraction job.

  ## Lifecycle

  1. Look up the extraction row by `file_uuid`. If terminal
     (`extracted` / `scanned_no_text` / `failed`), no-op (retry of an
     already-done job, or duplicate enqueue from a content-dedup
     upload).
  2. Resolve the binary via `Storage.retrieve_file/1` — returns a
     temp path. Works whether the file lives on local disk, S3, or
     anything core supports.
  3. Mark `"extracting"`.
  4. `PdfEngines.open_best/1` picks the engine and reports the page
     count. If every engine refuses, that's fatal (the stored message
     lists each engine's reason).
  5. For each page, extract with the chosen engine, normalize, hash,
     upsert into the per-page content cache, insert a `pdf_pages` row.
  6. Transition to `extracted` (or `scanned_no_text` if all pages
     came back empty). Retryable failures leave the row `extracting`
     and return `{:error, _}` so Oban retries; `failed` is written
     only on the last attempt.

  ## Concurrency

  Configured via the host app's Oban queue config. Recommend
  `queue: :catalogue_pdf, limit: 2` so a 1000-page PDF doesn't pin
  CPU or block other queues.

  ## Deduplication

  Re-enqueueing the same content (duplicate-content upload, the self-heal
  `requeue_stuck_extractions/1`, or the per-PDF Retry button) is deduped
  *application-side* in `PdfLibrary.insert_extraction_job/1` — it skips
  the insert when a non-terminal `PdfExtractor` job already exists for the
  `file_uuid`. We deliberately do **not** use Oban's built-in `unique:`
  option: satisfying its compile-time check requires listing every
  incomplete state including `:suspended`, but that enum value is absent
  from the `oban_job_state` enum on hosts that upgraded the Oban *library*
  without running its latest *migration* — the uniqueness query then
  raises `22P02` and kills every enqueue. The app-side guard queries only
  the four states (`available` / `scheduled` / `executing` / `retryable`)
  present in every Oban version. Races are harmless: this worker
  short-circuits on a terminal status and page inserts are upserts.
